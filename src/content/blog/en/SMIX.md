## Summary

To resume my experience in the middle grade cicle:

Through these two years I learned general IT at a medium level. From building computer to create network designs taking into account specific needs.

I'm aware that this course doesn't add much value to my resume given the level it belongs to, but I think it was vital to have taken this course.

### Recognitions & Awards

During the durations of these studies I obtained the next Titles and Recognitions:

- Cisco IT Essentials
- Microsoft Office Specialist Word 2013
- Microsoft Office Specialist Excel 2013
- B2 English Certificate from Oxford
- Best grade of the class

## Why a medium cycle?

If I had to choose again, I would choose it over and over.

When you ask a high schooler: *Hey, what will you want to study?*

Most probably they would respond with an *I don't know*

But this was not my case, I already knew for some years that I wanted to study IT, simply because it was a topic I was passionate about. I love to tinker with Arduino and create programs that only executed if you had enough faith.

I had it so clear, that in my high school life it was at the same time my **blessing** and my **curse**. It's clear why is it a blessing, who wouldn't like to know so young what do you want to do in life, the problem was that the rest of topics were getting uninteresting.

Every class was very boring, the ***why do I have to study this if it seems so useless***, repeated continuously in my head. It was very boring for a 12 year old child to be sat in a chair and get forced to study thing I had 0 interest about, instead, when I came home I loved to investigate how to build web pages or how to make python programs.

The point is that, yes, I was passing, but not with the best grades. Because of that, when I got to choose between the two options that every 4th year high schooler kid gets to choose, that two options looked like this:

- prep: continue as this, studying things that you are not interested in, but even harder, and also compete to enter the University.
- Medium and Superior cicle: don't worry, you can start studying what you like, slower but better.

How could I resist to go to a medium cycle with that condition, even with getting to the University as an objective, from a Superior cycle it was still possible, only taking 2 more years to get there.

## Impact on my professional trajectory

I always say that this phase was crucial for mi, because, although it was not that important at the resume, it would define my career and the path I would follow later on.

When I got in to the cycle and the classes began, I noticed that I was finally studying something I wanted to. At first they were simple things like using Word or Excel but then more specific subjects like networking and web programming came. It was with the last one that I truly saw what part of the IT I really enjoyed. 

I already created some basic pages using **HTML and CSS** before but doing it in class and seeing more details, fueled my curiosity so I started to study in more autodidact way and learned **JavaScript** with some **React** fundaments by the time I finished the Cycle.

Developing that curiosity to learn more was really important, it was what helped me to not only stay with the class knowledge, but to go further to gain firmness in my knowledge
