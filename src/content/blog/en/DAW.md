## Summary

During my time in this vocational training course, I learned many things described below, as well as **Git** and **Github** to handle version control for my projects.

Aside from the technologies, I learned many **design** patterns and **Accessibility** principles to create applications focused on User Experience (**UX**), aiming to build applications that are not only functional but also visually pleasing.

It goes without saying that I also learned how to **deploy my applications** on different services or on my own servers.

### Acknowledgments and Achievements

- Windows Server Certification
- OracleDB PL/SQL Certification
- Honors Distinction
- Best academic record in the center
- Best academic record in Catalonia

### Technologies and Concepts Learned

This course was more intense in terms of curriculum, and I learned several things during this phase.

| **Front-end** Technologies | **Back-end** Technologies | Server Management |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| HTML & CSS                 | PHP                       | Ubuntu Server     |
| Vanilla JavaScript         | NodeJS                    | NGINX & Apache    |
| React                      | Java                      | Proxy             |
| Astro (this page is made with Astro) | SQL Databases   | Mail Servers      |
| Figma (for design)         | NoSQL Databases           | SSL & SSH         |
| TailwindCSS & Bootstrap    | CodeIgniter               | Backups           |

To all these technologies, I must add other qualities that are not purely technical but are nonetheless very important:

- Teamwork
- Communication and project leadership
- Time management
- Responsibility and commitment
- Critical thinking

## The Logical Next Step

When I was finishing my **intermediate vocational training**, I was presented with the following options:

- Start working
- System and Network Administration
- Multi-platform Application Development
- Web Application Development

Starting to work was not an option; I was very clear that I wanted to continue studying to reach university. Out of the 3 higher vocational training cycles related to computing, my institute offered 2: **System and Network Administration** and **Web Application Development.**

The decision was simple. During the intermediate cycle, I had already developed a taste for programming and had even touched upon web technologies. Therefore, there was no other correct option for me than to do Web Application Development.

## Impact on My Career Path

These were some of the best years of my education. I was narrowing down what I wanted to do and discovering the technologies that are my favorites today.

Aside from giving me knowledge in web programming, it also helped me consolidate general programming concepts because, in the first year, web development is touched upon quite lightly. It consisted mostly of **Java** or **C++** exercises to practice, as at that point, it is not assumed that you have basic programming concepts.

All this combined catapulted my interest in investigating the technologies we touched on in class, and it was the era in which I researched the most on my own. I tried to learn something new constantly, from details like new CSS properties to technologies unknown to me at the time like **Angular, Vue, or React.**

Ultimately, the maximum expression of this was seen in the **final project of the cycle**. The theme was to create a web application using at least the learned technologies; I ended up creating, with my partner, a **web and mobile application** using **React, React Native, and ExpressJS**.

The application is currently not deployed because it was a class project, but I leave the repositories with the code here so that anyone who wants to can read it or deploy it locally if they wish:
